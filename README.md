# Duke_FinalCapstoneProject
Built a Java movie recommender for my Duke (Coursera) capstone. Parsed ~3K films and ~1K user ratings (CSV), modeled raters, and used user-based collaborative filtering (dot product) to generate top-N picks. Integrated a web runner so users rate 10â€“20 movies and see a styled HTML table of recommendations. Stack: Java, Commons CSV, BlueJ.
